        My Journey: From Tech Enthusiast to Full-Stack Developer
      </h1>

      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-800 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Life often takes us on unexpected journeys, and mine has been no
        exception. Although I spent five years dedicated to the field of
        <span className="font-medium text-blue-600"> physiotherapy</span>—helping
        people recover from injuries, regain their mobility, and improve their
        quality of life—my true passion for technology has always been a part of
        who I am.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-800 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        My love for tech began early. I was just six years old when I got my
        first computer, and I spent countless hours playing
        <span className="font-medium text-green-600"> Mario Bros</span> and{" "}
        <span className="font-medium text-green-600">Pac-Man</span>, mesmerized by
        the digital worlds I could explore. My curiosity quickly grew beyond
        just playing games. By the time I discovered
        <span className="font-medium text-pink-500"> Neopets</span>, I was creating
        custom pet pages, learning
        <span className="font-medium text-red-600"> HTML</span> and{" "}
        <span className="font-medium text-red-600">CSS</span> to showcase my pets'
        characters in ways that felt uniquely mine.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-800 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        My first collaborative project came when my cousin and I built a website
        on
        <span className="font-medium text-indigo-500"> GeoCities</span> for our
        fictional company. We had no formal training, just a shared excitement
        for creating something out of nothing using code. Not long after, a
        friend and I launched a forum using templates we found online. I loved
        tweaking the CSS to customize the look and feel, making the forum our
        own little corner of the internet.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-800 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        My passion for technology wasn't limited to just websites. I loved to
        customize my devices as well. I spent hours installing themes on my
        <span className="font-medium text-yellow-500"> Nokia phone</span>, and I went
        a step further by jailbreaking my
        <span className="font-medium text-blue-600"> iPod Touch</span> and rooting my{" "}
        <span className="font-medium text-green-600">Android phone</span> to unlock
        extended capabilities and install fancy themes and widgets. Each of
        these experiences taught me something new and deepened my love for
        technology.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-800 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        But when it came time to choose a career, I followed my parents'
        expectations and pursued a degree in
        <span className="font-medium text-blue-600"> Physiotherapy</span> instead of
        studying Computer Science. Although I found the work rewarding, I
        couldn't shake the feeling that I was meant to be doing something
        different—something that combined my love for problem-solving with my
        lifelong passion for technology.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-800 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The seed of my transition into full-stack development was planted during
        my time as a physiotherapist. I was always drawn to the analytical side
        of my work—understanding the biomechanics of the human body, diagnosing
        issues, and crafting tailored treatment plans. I realized that what I
        loved most about physiotherapy was the
        <span className="font-semibold text-purple-600"> problem-solving</span>{" "}
        aspect. The more complex the case, the more I thrived. This realization
        led me to wonder if there was another field where I could channel this
        passion.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-800 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        My first foray back into coding was purely out of curiosity. I signed up
        for
        <span className="font-medium text-indigo-500"> Harvard’s CS50</span> course,
        thinking it would be a useful skill to have, even if only as a hobby.
        But what started as a casual interest quickly turned into an obsession.
        I found myself spending every spare moment learning
        <span className="font-medium text-red-600"> HTML</span>,{" "}
        <span className="font-medium text-red-600">CSS</span>, and{" "}
        <span className="font-medium text-red-600">JavaScript</span>, and before I
        knew it, I was building small projects and experimenting with different
        technologies. The more I learned, the more I realized that this was the
        challenge I had been searching for.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-800 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        It wasn't long before I decided to take the leap and make a career
        change. I enrolled in a rigorous coding bootcamp, committing myself
        fully to the journey of becoming a full-stack developer. The bootcamp
        was intense, but it was exactly what I needed. It pushed me to my
        limits, teaching me not just the technical skills required to build
        full-stack applications, but also how to think like a developer. I
        learned how to break down complex problems into manageable pieces, how
        to write clean, efficient code, and how to collaborate with others to
        bring a project to life.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-800 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        One of the most surprising aspects of this journey has been the
        realization of how much my background in physiotherapy has influenced my
        approach to development. The skills I honed as a physiotherapist—
        <span className="font-medium text-orange-600"> critical thinking</span>,{" "}
        <span className="font-medium text-orange-600">empathy</span>,{" "}
        <span className="font-medium text-orange-600">communication</span>—are the
        same skills that make me a better developer today. Whether I’m debugging
        a piece of code or designing a user interface, I find myself drawing on
        these experiences, using them to create solutions that are both
        functional and user-friendly.
      </p>


      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-800 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        I’m looking forward to what’s next and am ready to take on new
        challenges, combining my passion for technology with the problem-solving
        mindset I’ve developed over the years. Thank you for taking the time to
        learn about my story—I can’t wait to see where this new path leads.
